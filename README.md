Social Mining Install
=====================

This project is a bash shell script for automating the installation and setup of a social media data mining project on a Linux server.

This is my first github project and I intend to build and commit changes in numerous iterations as I learn the process of checking in updates to github. Along the way the installation script will grow in complexity and the project will increase in functionality.

For the very first iteration the script contains a simple one-line command to update the operating system: 

``` sudo apt-get update ```
